<p>We run weekend kayaking trips to exotic locations around the South Island of NZ. Think Tekapo, Hawea, Rangitata. Beutiful. Here are some photos:
</p><img src="" alt=""><img src="" alt="">

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>theoucc(at)gmail(dot)com</p>
<p>Can't work this out? That's ok, the tramping club will have you.
</p>

<div id="basics">
	<h2>Basics</h2>
	<p>Semester One. Most of our activity happens during the first 6 weeks of semester 1 each year (Feb-May). We find that after the mid-semester break, the water gets colder, and students start to have real work to do.
	</p>
	<p>If you've missed it, you can still email us and have a chat, but the trips aren't as often.
	</p>
</div>


<p>However, if it's before or DURING semester one, email NOW. It's over so quickly, and it's easy to miss out if you don't act.
</p>
<p>You can still become a member later on in the year. We often take the boats out the the various beaches around Dunedin, and there are a few big trips around the Island. You are welcome to borrow gear to go on your own trips if you're a member.
</p>

<p>Websites are funny things. If you want the latest info, head over to our Facebook page. No, seriously, the stuff here is good info, but you REALLY want to check that out.
</p>

<h2>So.. what do you do? Canoeing?</h2>
<p>Um.. No. It's really just whitewater kayaking. The name is a vestige of our history and we love the acronym. Plus all our gear has "OUCC" stamped on it, so we just kept the name.
</p>

<div id="howitworks">
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>You join up, pay your membership fee,
		Number one goal for you is to get onto our mailing list for the year.
		You can do that by sending a friendly email to theoucc(at)gmail.com (we )
		We send an email out early in the week, usually Tuesday night, about the upcoming trip that weekend.
		Start thinking about whether you can come.</p>

		<p>On Thursdays at around 1:30pm, we have a trip meeting in the Clubs and Socs Building. (pic).
		</p>
		<p>This is where we give you a bit more information and you put your name on the trip list. We only have so much gear, so it's first come, first served.
		</p><p>On Friday afternoon, we all meet at the gear shed around the back of Clubs and Socs, and you pick out all your gear.
		</p><p>We leave after this so make sure you have everything you want for the weekend.
		</p>
		<p>You need a helmet, paddle, lifejacket, spray deck, and of course, a kayak.
		Make sure you have all this stuff.
		Talk to a member of the Exec for help.</p>
		<p>When you've picked out the gear you want, please clip it all inside your kayak so it won't fall out during the trip.
		</p><p>We then pack all the gear onto the trailer. (pic) Please help as much as possible with this. EVen if you can';t tie knots (you should probablky learn) you can help lift boats onto the trailer.
		</p>
		<p>Once the trailer is loaded and all tied down, we allocate people into cars or vans and set off on our adventure.
		This is normally about 6:30, so we generally stop somewhere for dinner.
		Some of the campping spots are a long way from Dunedin so it's often dark when we get there. Bring a torch.</p>
</div>

<div id="costs">
	<h2>Sounds good, how much do I owe you?</h2>
	We try to keep all trips as cheap as possible.
	<h3>Membership: </h3>
	<p>	$60 if you don't have your own kayaking gear, you can borrow ours all year.
		$30 if you have your own paddling gear</p>

	<h3>Trip Cost:</h3>
	<p>Around $20-30 each trip.
	</p>
	<p>This depends how far we have to drive and what the camping situation is like.
	</p><p>This fee pays for petrol for the vehicles, van hire, and accomodation.
	</p>
	<h2>I'm scared. I don't know anyone else going.</h2>
	<p>That's all you're worried about? This is consistently the friendliest bunch of people in Dunedin. You have a 2+ hour van ride to meet people before we even get there, so it'll be fine.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="bring">
	<h2>What should I bring?</h2>
		Pack what you'd take to a 2 day camping trip at a place with no power or running water. Which could be sunny and hot or rainy and cold. This is New Zealand.

		Still need ideas?
		- Tent
		- Sleeping bag
		- Bed roll
		- Food for 2x breakfasts, 2x lunches, and 1x dinner
		- Alcohol for Saturday night
		- Torch, preferably a headlamp
		- Baking


		Clothes
		- Some warm gear for the nights
		- Clothes for kayaking in. Generally a wetsuit is advisable. Good paddlejackets are also fine.
		- Bring plenty of polyprops.
		- Jandels for wearing around camp and in your boat. We often walk over rocks to get in and out of the water, so some shoes that can get wet are a good idea.
</div>

<div id="expect">
	<h2>What should I expect?</h2>
		<p>Once we get to the camping spot on Friday night, we set up camp and go to bed.
		On Saturday morning, we get up fairly early, get our paddling gear on, and get dropped off at the "get-in" (where we get in).</p>
		<p>Everyone's split into groups under instructors and they will look after you.
		</p>
		<p>On Saturday, we generally do a morning paddle, come back to the campsite for lunch, then set off for an afternoon paddle somewhere.
		</p><p>After our last run for the day, we settle down at the campsite for dinner. What happens after this varies widely but usually involves the consumption of a good amount of alcohol and the having of a lot of fun. We're normally in the middle of nowhere with no other groups around, so anything can happen.
		</p>
		<p>Sunday morning. Everyone gets up, some reluctantly, and we do another kayak run somewhere. After that's finished, we go back to the campsite, pack everything up and load the trailer, and set off back to Dunedin.
		</p>
		<p>We generally get back to the gear shed around 6pm, but it depends on the trip.
		</p>
</div>

<div id="murchison">

	<h2>What's this Murchison thing everyone gets so excited about?</h2>
		<p>Murchison is a sleepy little town in the north of the South Island that happends to be crawling with amazing rivers for kayaking. The NZ Kayak School is based here.
		Every year, in the mid-semester break, the club goes up to Murchison.</p>
</div>


<div id="neverkayaked">
	<h2>I've never kayaked before!</h2>
		<p>That's fine. Most of our members aren't strong kayakers when they start. We teach you how to kayak.
		</p>
</div>

<div id="cannotroll">
	<h2>I can't eskimo-roll!</h2>
		<p>That's fine. Rolling isn't essential but the longer you stay dry, the more fun it is. We hold rolling sessions up at Moana Pool in the mornings, twice a week, Wednesdays and Fridays, until May, which you should come to and learn. It's a lot easier to learn in a heated pool, and our instructors are very helpful. Plus, you can hang out in the spa afterwards!</p>
</div>


<div id="cannotswim">
	<h2>I can't swim</h2>
		<p>Ooh. Well, we give you a lifejacket so you will definitely float, and the point is to STAY in the kayak, but most beginners fall out of their boats a couple of times. Come up to a rolling session and see if you're comfortable. Or learn to swim really quickly so you can come on the trips.</p>
</div>


<div id="safety">
	<h2>Is it safe?</h2>
		<p>Yes. As casual as may seem, we take safety very seriously. Most of the work goes on behind the scenes. We have very experienced instructors, and the rivers we paddle on are generally not very dangerous. Just wear your helmet and follow instructions. It seems a lot scarier than it is.</p>
</div>


<div id="goodpaddler">
<h2>I'm a Grade III + paddler. Would I get any benefit from coming?</h2>
<p>If you're really good, you probably won't be challenged much on most of the weekend trips. Tekapo has a surfing hole, and Murchison has advanced runs. We try to do a few harder runs each trip but it doesn't always happen. We'd love to have you though. You could help the beginners and, of course, off the water is where the real fun begins.
</p>
</div>

<div id="where">
	<h2>Where in NZ do you go?</h2>
		<p>This depends on the year but our main haunts are:
		- Andersons Bay (introductory day)
		- Tekapo (river and slalom course)
		- Hawea
		- Beaumont
		- Rangitata
		- Mavoura Lakes
		- Murchison (week long trip in the April holidays)
		</p>
		<p>There are a few others that we sometimes got to, but these have proven to be the most fun and reliable.
		</p>
